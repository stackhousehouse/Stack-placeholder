		  	<h1>Macropod</h1>
		  	<p class="subhead">Brand development &plus; product design</p>
		  	<p>I spent a year as a designer at 
		  	<%= link_to 'Macropod', 'http://www.macropod.com' %>
		  	. When I joined the company it was known as 
		  	<%= link_to 'Bugherd', 'http://www.bugherd.com' %>, as was their popular bug-reporting product. We were working  to create a suite of productivity products aimed at designers and developers. So, the company name had to change and we became Macropod. I developed the new identity and implemented it across channels.</p>
		  	<p>I also worked intensively on Stack, a kanban-style project management product with integrations that would apeal to develpoers.</p>
		  	<p><strong>Note:</strong> Macropod has closed down Stack and rolled some of its features into Bugherd. The Macropod identity has been updated since, and is now featuring some really great illustration!</p>

		  	<h1>BBC Academy</h1>
		  	<p class="subhead">Responsive website</p>
		  	<p>The Academy website was one of the BBCâ€™s first fully responsive releases. The project was commissioned to bring the Colleges of Journalism, Technology, and Production together into one site.</p>
		  	<p>The project came with many challenges for our small team. The sheer volume of content, breadth of subject matter, variety of content types, and supported languages made for some good honest hard work. The result of which was a decent website, that has stood up well a few years on.</p>

		  	<h1>BBC Global Experience Language</h1>
		  	<p class="subhead">Design guidelines website</p>
		  	<p>I worked on the front-end for the two most recent generations of BBC's GEL (Global Experience Language) guidelines.</p>
		  	<p>Later, I provided consultation and attended BBC workshops on the future of the GEL project, covering issues of information architecture, content strategy, and responsive design.</p>

		  	Way back in 2010, my good friend  
		  	<%= link_to 'Adam Hill', 'http://www.adamhill.id.au/' %>
		  	and I were asked to give the Fahan School's

		  	<h1>Australian War Memorial London</h1>
		  	<p class="subhead">Website and information kiosk</p>
		  	<p>This is an old project, but still one of my favourites from the good ol' days of Flash.</p>
		  	<p>The project was designed to interpret the physical 
		  	<%= link_to 'War Memorial:', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_War_Memorial,_London' %>
		  	a granite wall engraved with every town and city from where Australian servicemen came. The depth of the engraving varied over the wall so when standing back a distance, the names of major battles were visible.</p>
		  	<p>I designed an interactive 3d globe marked with the locations of these battles. Selecting the locations on either the map or a schematic of the wall would zoom to a more detailed map displaying images, video and stories from the battles.</p>
		  	<p>Users were also able to search for the location of towns on the physical wall.</p>
